<h2>WordPress Security Analysis Tool</h2>

<p>WordMash allows you to compare two different WordPress sites - a broken (infected) one and a clean one - and then create an AI classifier to determine which files and data elements are malicious (viruses, malware, etc.) and which ones were intentional modifications.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Projects</strong> - Configure and manage comparison projects, each with a clean and dirty WordPress installation</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory</strong> - View file counts, lines of code, database tables and rows for each project</li>
    <li><strong>Statistics</strong> - Track project progress and AI classifier accuracy</li>
    <li><strong>Admin</strong> - System administration and settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get Started</h3>
<p>Head to <a href="/projects">Projects</a> to create a new comparison project or view existing ones.</p>
